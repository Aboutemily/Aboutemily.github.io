		<h2>ATM Reflection</h2>
		<p>The ATM program is a great program, when I first entered the program I knew nothing about computers or technology. I couldn't even type homerow. But now I know many of things and it has been very helpful to me and it will be helpful in the future as well. For projects I know how to use powerpoint, Excel, or Word thanks to the ATM program. Overall, I loved ATM and it really increased my knowledge on technology. </p>
