		<h2> My Interests</h2>
		<p> Some of my interests include taking care of animals and playing with them. Since my sister has a lot of pets and always gets pets that most people don’t own I have learned to grow a passion for taking care of them and playing with them. I also like swimming, ever since I was small I would always go swimming and I’d enjoy it alot. </p>
