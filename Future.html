		<h1> My Future </h1>
		<article>
		<h2>High School</h2>
		<p>My High School choices were either Millikan or Wilson. I chose Wilson as one of my choices because I’ve seen that it is a really good school and I want the best for my future. The elective that I chose for Wilson High School was med/Bio which is basically about medicine, health care, and laboratory diagnostics. The reason that I chose Millikan was because it is also a great school. The elective that I chose for Millikan was quest. </p>

		<h2>College</h2>
		<p>The college that I would want to go to is Long Beach City College. I want to graduate with my doctoral degree so then I can really be prepared for my career. I also have Cal State Long Beach University in mind and I would also want to graduate with a doctoral degree from there as well, if I go there.</p>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
		<p> I am interested in being a doctor or something in the medical field. I have always been interested in things like this. I remember when the show Untold Stories of the ER would come on TLC I’d be so excited to watch it and if I were to be busy while it was on, I would record it. It just interests me a lot. Also I have been really good in science and health, they are mostly the easiest classes for me.</p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p> Some of my interests include taking care of animals and playing with them. Since my sister has a lot of pets and always gets pets that most people don’t own I have learned to grow a passion for taking care of them and playing with them. I also like swimming, ever since I was small I would always go swimming and I’d enjoy it alot. </p>
