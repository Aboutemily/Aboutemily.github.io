		<h2>High School</h2>
		<p>My High School choices were either Millikan or Wilson. I chose Wilson as one of my choices because I’ve seen that it is a really good school and I want the best for my future. The elective that I chose for Wilson High School was med/Bio which is basically about medicine, health care, and laboratory diagnostics. The reason that I chose Millikan was because it is also a great school. The elective that I chose for Millikan was quest. </p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p> Some of my interests include taking care of animals and playing with them. Since my sister has a lot of pets and always gets pets that most people don’t own I have learned to grow a passion for taking care of them and playing with them. I also like swimming, ever since I was small I would always go swimming and I’d enjoy it alot. </p>
